___

WinAppsSys is a project that automates the installation of Windows Server 2019 Trial for WinApps. This allows users to use WinApps by skipping some of the system configuration.

INFO: This license is for non-commercial use only. If you want to use WinAppsSys professionally - you need to buy a Windows Server 2019 license.

The project prepares (to start with) the configuration of a custom ISO version based on the one from the Microsoft website by adding:
* VirtIO drivers for disk and network 
* Configuring registries for RemoteApp support
* Automatic License ReArm
* Pre-configuration

The default user created by WinAppsSys is: linux (password: linux).

The project belongs to the non-free group. If you want to use only free software, we recommend using Wine.

Project is not suitable for gaming (due to emulated graphics card and RDP limitations).
